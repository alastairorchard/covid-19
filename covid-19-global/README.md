The 'Realtime R0 Global Predictions' notebook is an adaption of Kevin Systrom's work on predicting Covid-19 infection rates. Instead of US data, global data is processed. The data is being updated daily by https://ourworldindata.org and automatically imported in this notebook. 

UPDATE: The HDI function has been improved which reduces the processing time significantly. The whole notebook can now complete within a few seconds. 

UPDATE-2: Automator tool was built on local machine which runs the notebook daily at 8:00PM until 2020-06-30. Results are stored in Daily Results folder.
